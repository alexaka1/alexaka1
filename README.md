## Hello there. I'm Alex.
### Chronic skill issues
I care about online privacy and security. Fuller-stack developer.

My main languages are `C#` and `Typescript`.

# Currently focusing on

My job at GoTo.

# Projects worth mentioning:

- [Distroless .Net healthchecks](https://github.com/alexaka1/distroless-dotnet-healthchecks)
- [Serilog Utf8JsonFormatter](https://github.com/alexaka1/serilog-extensions)
- [Next.js app for an event I attended](https://github.com/alexaka1/mhu-nextjs-sport)
- I contributed the `SimpleLogin` provider to `Auth.js`.

## Looking ahead

I wish to make something out of [Tailwind OKLCH](https://github.com/alexaka1/tailwindcss-oklch) before Tailwind 4 releases. If not, I'll see what actually gets added in 4 and then alter the lib accordingly.

I plan on making more contributions to FOSS projects, especially for tools I already use.

## What I want to learn:

- Dev containers
- Test containers
- Passkey auth in my apps
- YARP
